Aakash Ahamed is a hydrologist and remote sensing scientist developing methods to quantify water and carbon using sensors on satellites, aircraft, drones, and smartphones. His research has applications in water resources, natural hazards, agriculture, and energy. He completed his [doctoral studies](https://earth.stanford.edu/people/aakash-ahamed) in the Department of Geophysics at [Stanford University](https://gemcenter.stanford.edu/), where his thesis project involved the development of physics based models of groundwater systems in California, leveraging data from over 15 satellite instruments.

Aakash is currently the CTO of [Working Trees](http://workingtrees.com), and previously worked as a support scientist in the [Hydrological Sciences Lab](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/earth/hydrology/) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, where he constructed [satellite-based models of flood and landslide hazards](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/scientists-deploy-damage-assessment-tool-in-laos-relief-efforts/). He was recently awarded a National Geographic Explorer Fellowship to integrate drone imagery into satellite-based flood monitoring systems. He has also developed remote sensing analyses and software at [Ceres Imaging](https://www.ceresimaging.net/), a successful precision agriculture start up based in Silicon Valley, and interned as a GIS analyst at the World Wildlife Fund for Nature in Washington, DC.
