Custom solutions for automated, real-time streaming of environmental data from sensor-networks deployed in the field, directly to the web.  

These cloud-based, lightweight, scalable groundwater observatory dashboards are easily applied to any [low cost sensor network](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12041066).

This solutions is well suited for groundwater monitoring to support implementation of [California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Groundwater-Management/SGMA-Groundwater-Management), but also general enough to be applied to real-time data from any sensor.
