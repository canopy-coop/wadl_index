We provide custom solutions for automated, real-time streaming of environmental data from in-situ, sensor-networks deployed in the field to remote satellite sensors, all directly accessible on the web.  

Most solutions in this space have been applied to groundwater monitoring to support implementation of [California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Groundwater-Management/SGMA-Groundwater-Management). They include software and dashboards to track Sustainable Management Criteria, water budgets, groundwater model output, in-situ sensors (e.g., aquifer storage and recovery wells, flood- and Ag-MAR projects, streamflow) and remotely sensed data (e.g., NDVI, SAR). Importantly, these tools and technologies are applicable to any system. Where no solution exists in our toolbox, we designed custom solutions for clients.
