Near-real-time estimates of changes in groundwater storage are critical to effectively monitor hydrologic systems. However, few methods exist that can assess both local and regional aquifer dynamics, especially in regions where groundwater monitoring wells are sparse or data is not publicly available. We developed a remote sensing based water mass balance method- the Hybrid Data Remote Sensing Assimilation (HyDRA) system, which integrates remotely sensed and in situ hydrologic data and models to estimate changes in groundwater storage at multiple spatial scales.
