Landslide event inventories are a vital resource for landslide susceptibility and forecasting applications. However, landslide inventories can vary in accuracy, availability, and timeliness as a result of varying detection methods, reporting, and data availability. 

This study used change detection algorithms in an automated software framework applied to [NASA satellite data](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/using-nasa-data-to-detect-potential-landslides) to identify areas of new bare-earth exposures that may be landslide events. The study also presents a precipitation monitoring tool that helps  identify the timing of potential landslide events.
